## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

cd reactjs_project
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

Install the necessary dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Set Up Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root directory to configure environment-specific variables:

```env
# React app environment variables
REACT_APP_API_URL=https://api.yourdomain.com
```

### 4. Run the Development Server

Start the development server to preview your application:

```bash
npm run start
```

Your application will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

### 5. Build for Production

To create a production-ready build, use:

npm run build
```

The optimized files will be generated in the `build` directory.
